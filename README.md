# DailyGoalVerses
This is a creative project for REL A 121 under Dr. Hank Smith and TA Alyssa Ferrell. This tool is aimed to help anyone trying to get into a habit of studying scripture (more specifically, Book of Mormon), to get a daily goal of verses to read. Users just enter their available times during the day, and they get 5 verses to read at their available times. Overtime, the goal is to get into the habit of studying scripture daily.

How to use it:

1. Enter your name
2. Enter your top 5 available times during the day. The program will prompt for the hour, minute, and wether it is AM or PM.
3. The program will give you five random verses to read at those times.
